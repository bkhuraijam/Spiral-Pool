## What Is Spiral Pool?

Spiral Pool is **free, open-source, self-hosted Stratum mining pool software** for proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. Install it on your own bare-metal server, connect your ASIC miners directly, and block rewards go straight to your wallet. No custodians. No middlemen. No cloud.

Block rewards are embedded directly in the coinbase transaction paying the **miner's own wallet address**. The intended fund flow is: **Blockchain &rarr; Coinbase Transaction &rarr; Miner's Wallet.** There is no pool wallet, no intermediate balance, no fees, and no withdrawal process &mdash; the software is designed to never hold, route, or access funds at any point in the payment path.

At its core is the **Spiral Router** &mdash; a miner classification engine that identifies miners via 47 verified user-agent patterns at connection time and maps each to one of 14 SHA-256d or 8 Scrypt difficulty profiles before a single share is submitted. Paired with a **lock-free vardiff engine** using per-session atomic state, asymmetric ramp limits (4&times; up / 0.75&times; down), and a 50% variance floor, difficulty spirals toward equilibrium rather than oscillating around a target.

16 coins. 2 algorithms. 6 merge-mining pairs. One binary.

### No Tiers. No Licensing. No Strings.

Spiral Pool is released under the BSD-3-Clause license with no commercial licensing tiers, no premium editions, no paywalls, no freemium upsells, no subscription gates, no "community vs. enterprise" split, and no feature locks of any kind. Every capability ships in a single codebase available to every operator equally.

The software collects **no telemetry, no analytics, no usage metrics, and no phone-home data** &mdash; not optionally, not anonymously, not ever. There are no embedded tracking endpoints and no remote feature flags. The dashboard loads fonts and JavaScript libraries from third-party CDNs by default (see [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for details and self-hosting guidance); aside from these standard web resources, the software makes no outbound connections to any third party on behalf of the operator.

There is no token, no chain, no governance layer, and no protocol-level fee extraction. Spiral Pool is infrastructure software, not a platform.

This is pure free and open-source software. Fork it, audit it, modify it, redistribute it. The code speaks for itself.

> **SINGLE-OPERATOR NOTICE:** Spiral Pool is designed for **one operator running their own miners**. One wallet address per coin is set at install time &mdash; **all block rewards go to that address**, regardless of which miner found the block. If you allow others to mine on your pool, you must inform them that their hashrate contributes to your wallet, not their own. See [WARNINGS.md](WARNINGS.md) and [TERMS.md Section 5E](TERMS.md).

## Who This Is For

- **Solo miners** running dedicated ASIC hardware who want full sovereignty over their pool infrastructure
- **Home miners** with diverse hardware &mdash; ESP32 lottery miners, BitAxe, Avalon, Antminer &mdash; all on one pool
- **Operators** who need complete vardiff visibility and runtime tuning

**Not for:** managed pool services, proportional payout splitting (this is solo-only), or operators without Linux sysadmin experience. Cloud/VPS is technically supported but **not recommended** &mdash; see [WARNINGS.md](WARNINGS.md) and [CLOUD_OPERATIONS.md](docs/setup/CLOUD_OPERATIONS.md).

---

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Ubuntu 24.04.x LTS** | **Supported** | Native install. Docker available. **x86_64 only.** |
| **Ubuntu 26.04.x LTS** | **Supported** | Native install. Docker available. **x86_64 only.** |
| **Debian 13 "Trixie"** | **Supported** | Native install. **x86_64 only.** Docker images use Ubuntu base. |
| **Windows 11 &mdash; Docker Desktop** | **Experimental** | Automated single-coin setup via `install-windows.ps1`. See [Windows Guide](docs/setup/WINDOWS_GUIDE.md). |
| **Windows 11 &mdash; WSL2 Native** | **Experimental** | Full feature set via `install.sh` inside WSL2. Requires [port forwarding](scripts/windows/start-wsl2-proxy.bat) and [shutdown hook](scripts/windows/wsl2-shutdown-hook.ps1). See [Windows Guide](docs/setup/WINDOWS_GUIDE.md). |

---

## Quick Start

> **New to servers?** See the [Server Preparation Guide](docs/setup/OPERATIONS.md#0-server-preparation--ubuntu-2404x-lts-or-2604x-lts) first.

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu Server 24.04.x LTS or 26.04.x LTS (minimized) **or Debian 13 "Trixie"**, x86_64
- 10 GB RAM minimum (16 GB recommended)
- 150 GB SSD minimum (Bitcoin: ~600 GB &mdash; see [Storage Requirements](docs/setup/OPERATIONS.md#2-storage-requirements))
- IPv4 network (IPv6 not supported)
- Bare metal or self-hosted VM strongly recommended

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
sudo apt-get -y install git
```

### Install

**Option A &mdash; Git clone:**

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/SpiralPool/Spiral-Pool.git
cd Spiral-Pool && ./install.sh
```

**Option B &mdash; ZIP archive:**

```bash
unzip Spiral-Pool.zip
cd Spiral-Pool && ./install.sh
```

The installer automates the full stack: coin daemons, PostgreSQL, Go toolchain, stratum compilation, TLS certificates, systemd services, firewall rules, and monitoring. Checkpoint resume means a failed install can be re-run safely.

**Option C &mdash; Docker:**

```bash
cd docker && cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set POOL_COIN and POOL_ADDRESS (or POOL_MODE=multi for multi-coin)
./generate-secrets.sh
docker compose --profile dgb up -d
```

Docker supports V1 + V2 Stratum (plain, TLS, Noise), all 17 coins, multi-coin mode, and merge mining. For HA with VIP failover, use native installation. See [DOCKER_GUIDE.md](docs/setup/DOCKER_GUIDE.md).

### Connect Your Miners

```
URL:      stratum+tcp://YOUR_SERVER_IP:PORT
Worker:   YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS.worker_name
Password: x
```

See [REFERENCE.md](docs/reference/REFERENCE.md) for all coin-specific stratum ports.

### Notifications

Spiral Sentinel supports real-time alerts via **Discord**, **Telegram**, **XMPP/Jabber**, **ntfy**, **SMTP email**, and **generic webhooks** (HTTP POST to any URL &mdash; Zapier, Home Assistant, IFTTT, PagerDuty, n8n) for block discoveries, miner status changes, temperature warnings, and hashrate reports. Configure during installation or in `~/.spiralsentinel/config.json`. See [SENTINEL.md](docs/reference/SENTINEL.md) for setup details.
