## 1. System Overview

Spiral Pool is a mining pool server written in Go that supports 17 coins across SHA-256d and Scrypt proof-of-work algorithms. It serves mining jobs to connected miners via the Stratum protocol (V1 JSON-RPC and V2 binary/Noise), validates submitted shares, detects blocks, tracks block maturation, and pays miners.

### Core Design Principles

- **Reliability first** — WAL journaling, crash recovery, reorg detection, payment fencing
- **Lock-free hot path** — atomic operations on share validation and difficulty adjustment
- **Intelligent defaults** — automatic miner hardware detection sets optimal difficulty
- **Operator control** — extensive tuning knobs, per-worker metrics, HA clustering
- **IPv4 only** — all networking is IPv4. IPv6 is disabled at the OS level by the installer

## 3. Miner Connection and Classification (Spiral Router)

Spiral Router automatically detects mining hardware at connection time and assigns optimal initial difficulty without requiring miners to use separate ports per device class.

Source: `internal/stratum/spiralrouter.go`

### Detection Pipeline (3-Tier Priority)

```
Miner Connects
    |
    v
+----------------------------------+
|  Tier 1: IP-Based Device Hints   |  <-- Sentinel pre-registers known devices
|  (highest priority)              |      with exact hashrate measurements
|                                  |
|  Lookup IP in hint cache         |
|  If found: Diff = HR x Target    |
|            / 2^32                |
+----------+-----------------------+
           | miss
           v
+----------------------------------+
|  Tier 2: User-Agent Matching     |  <-- 48 verified regex patterns for
|  (primary classification)        |      mining hardware & firmware
|                                  |
|  Match against pattern database  |
|  Map to MinerClass enum          |
|  Return class-specific profile   |
+----------+-----------------------+
           | no match
           v
+----------------------------------+
|  Tier 3: Default (Unknown)       |  <-- Conservative initial difficulty
|  (fallback)                      |      VarDiff adjusts from there
+----------------------------------+
```

### Miner Classification

15 SHA-256d profiles and 8 Scrypt profiles (including Unknown fallback) with separate difficulty settings per algorithm. Full tables with exact values are in [REFERENCE.md](../reference/REFERENCE.md).

### Block-Time-Aware Scaling

Initial difficulty is scaled based on the coin's block time to maintain share cadence relative to block intervals. Implemented in `scaleProfilesForBlockTime()` at `spiralrouter.go:484`.

- **DigiByte** (15s blocks): Shorter target share times for faster feedback
- **Bitcoin** (600s blocks): Longer target share times to avoid flooding

## 4. Stratum Protocol Layer

### Supported Protocols

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Stratum V1 | JSON-RPC over TCP, newline-delimited |
| Stratum V2 | Binary encoding, Noise Protocol encryption |
| TLS | Separate TLS listener port per coin (V1 with TLS 1.2+) |

Port assignments per coin are in [REFERENCE.md](../reference/REFERENCE.md).

### V1 Handshake

```
     Miner                            Pool
       |                                |
       |---- mining.subscribe --------->|
       |<--- subscribe response --------|  (extranonce1, en2_size)
       |<--- mining.set_difficulty -----|  (initial difficulty from Router)
       |---- mining.authorize --------->|  (address.worker, password)
       |<--- authorize response --------|
       |<--- mining.notify -------------|  (job_id, prevhash, coinbase, ...)
       |                                |
       |---- mining.submit ------------>|  (worker, job_id, en2, ntime, nonce)
       |<--- submit response -----------|
       |<--- mining.set_difficulty -----|  (VARDIFF adjustment)
       |<--- mining.notify -------------|  (new block template)
```

### Stratum V2

- Noise Protocol Framework encryption (authenticated, encrypted channel)
- Binary message encoding (lower bandwidth)
- Native version rolling support
- Job template negotiation

### Connection State Machine (FSM)

```
INITIAL --> SUBSCRIBED --> AUTHORIZED --> WORKING --> DISCONNECTED
```

Any message received out of FSM order is rejected. See [SECURITY_MODEL.md](SECURITY_MODEL.md) for enforcement details.

### Session Structure

```
Session
  ID                  uint64       // Unique session ID (atomic counter)
  ExtraNonce1         string       // 4-byte unique prefix
  ExtraNonce2Size     int          // Usually 4 bytes
  WorkerName          string       // "address.worker_name"
  MinerAddress        string       // Payout address
  UserAgent           string       // e.g. "cgminer/4.12.1"
  authorized          uint32       // Atomic: 1 if authorized (deprecated bool alias exists)
  subscribed          uint32       // Atomic: 1 if subscribed (deprecated bool alias exists)
  difficultyBits      uint64       // Current session difficulty (atomic, unexported)
  prevDifficultyBits  uint64       // Previous difficulty (grace period, unexported)
  // VARDIFF state stored externally in Pool/CoinPool sessionStates sync.Map, keyed by session.ID
```

Source: `pkg/protocol/protocol.go`

---

## 5. Job Generation and Distribution

### Job Lifecycle

1. **Block notification** arrives via ZMQ (preferred, <1s latency) or RPC polling (5s fallback)
2. **Block template** fetched via `getblocktemplate` (BIP 22/23)
3. **Coinbase transaction** built with pool payout address, coinbase text, witness commitment
4. **Merkle tree** computed and cached
5. **Job ID** assigned: 2-char coin prefix + 6-char hex counter (e.g., `dg00000001`)
6. **Broadcast** `mining.notify` to all connected, authorized sessions

Source: `internal/jobs/manager.go`

### Job Freshness

- **Maximum template age**: `blockTime x 4` (minimum 1 min, maximum 10 min)
- **Circuit breaker**: Trips if template remains stale beyond threshold (stops serving jobs)
- **Recovery**: Clears when fresh template arrives

### RPC Health Tracking

| Condition | State | Pool Behavior |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Score >= 0.8 | Healthy | Normal operation |
| Score >= 0.5 | Degraded | Serve cached jobs, log warnings |
| Score < 0.5 | Unhealthy | Reduced confidence, increased logging |
| 5+ consecutive fails | Offline | Stop serving jobs, alert operator |

---

## 6. Share Submission and Validation

### Validation Pipeline

```
mining.submit arrives
    |
    v
1. Parse parameters (worker, job_id, extranonce2, ntime, nonce)
    |
2. Rate limit check (allowShare per-IP throttle)
    |
3. Job lookup (hash map, RWMutex read lock)
    |
4. Staleness check (job age < maxJobAge)
    |
5. Duplicate check (per-job nonce tracking)
    |
6. Reconstruct block header
    |
7. Hash header (SHA256d or Scrypt)
    |
8. Difficulty check:
   share_diff >= session_diff?  --> Accept share
   share_diff >= network_diff?  --> BLOCK FOUND
```

Source: `internal/shares/validator.go`

### Grace Period for Difficulty Changes

When difficulty increases, miners with queued work at old difficulty submit valid shares that appear "too low". The pool maintains the previous difficulty for a grace window:

- Shares for Job < DiffChangeJob: Accept at `prevDiffBits`
- Shares for Job = DiffChangeJob: Accept at `min(prevDiffBits, currentDiffBits)`
- Shares for Job > DiffChangeJob: Require `currentDiffBits`

---

## 7. Variable Difficulty Engine (VARDIFF)

### Per-Session State (Lock-Free Atomics)

```
SessionState
  difficultyBits      atomic.Uint64   // Current difficulty (float64 bits)
  shareCount          atomic.Uint64   // Total shares
  lastShareNano       atomic.Int64    // Last share timestamp (ns)
  lastRetargetNano    atomic.Int64    // Last retarget timestamp (ns)
  sharesSinceRetarget atomic.Uint64   // Shares in current window
  consecutiveNoChange atomic.Uint64   // Backoff counter for stability
```

Source: `internal/vardiff/vardiff.go:53-75`

### Retarget Algorithm

```
Every retargetTime (default 60s):

    actualTime   = elapsed / sharesSinceRetarget
    targetTime   = per-session target (from Spiral Router profile)

    variance = (actualTime - targetTime) / targetTime * 100

    if abs(variance) <= 50%:   // Hardcoded floor (config cannot go lower)
        return  // No adjustment needed

    factor = targetTime / actualTime

    if factor > 4.0:
        factor = 4.0           // Max 4x increase
    else if factor < 0.75:
        factor = 0.75          // Max 0.75x decrease

    newDiff = currentDiff * factor
    clamp(newDiff, minDiff, maxDiff)
```

The `lastRetargetNano` field uses compare-and-swap (`vardiff.go:198`) to ensure exactly one goroutine performs retarget calculation when multiple shares arrive simultaneously.

### Why Asymmetric Limits (4x up, 0.75x down)

When difficulty increases, miners continue submitting valid shares at the old (lower) difficulty until their work queue empties. These shares arrive faster than expected, which looks like "miner is slow" to the pool. Symmetric adjustment would decrease difficulty, then the miner applies the increase and submits faster, triggering another increase. The asymmetric limits break this oscillation cycle.

### Aggressive Retarget (Ramp-Up)

During initial convergence, the engine triggers aggressive retarget with asymmetric thresholds:
- Shares too fast (ratio < 0.8): trigger increase
- Shares too slow (ratio > 2.0): trigger decrease

Only applies when change exceeds 5% to avoid noise.

Source: `internal/vardiff/vardiff.go:398-475`

### Retarget Backoff

When no adjustment is needed across multiple retarget windows, `consecutiveNoChange` increments. The pool handler applies a backoff multiplier (`count + 1`, capped at 4×) to extend the retarget interval and reduce unnecessary computation.

## 8. Share Pipeline and Persistence

### Lock-Free Pipeline Architecture

```

### Backpressure Mechanism

| Buffer Fill % | Level | Difficulty Multiplier |
|---------------|-------|----------------------|
| < 70% | None | 1.0x (normal) |
| 70-89% | Warn | 1.5x |
| 90-97% | Critical | 2.0x |
| > 98% | Emergency | 4.0x |

---

## 9. Block Discovery and Submission

A block is discovered when `share_difficulty >= network_difficulty`.

### Block Submission Flow

1. Build complete block (header + coinbase + all transactions)
2. Write block to WAL (durability before submission)
3. Submit via RPC: `submitblock(<block_hex>)`
   - Uses `callNoRetry()` — single attempt, no retries (block submission is time-critical; any delay risks the block going stale)
4. Record in `blocks_{pool}` table (status: `pending`)
5. Broadcast `mining.notify` with `clean_jobs=true` to all miners
6. Update Prometheus metrics
7. Send Discord/Telegram alert via Sentinel

Source: `internal/pool/pool.go` (handleBlock), `internal/daemon/client.go` (submitblock)

## 10. Block Maturation and Reorg Detection

### Block State Machine

```
PENDING --> CONFIRMED
              |
              v (reorg)
           ORPHANED
```

> **Note:** The `paid` status exists in the database schema but is never set in SOLO mode. Since the coinbase transaction pays the miner directly at block creation time, blocks remain in `confirmed` status permanently. The `processMatureBlocks()` and `executePendingPayments()` functions are no-op stubs.

### Maturation Tracking (Payment Processor Cycle, ~10 min)

**Step 1: Snapshot Chain Tip**
- `currentHeight = getblockchaininfo().blocks`
- If tip changes mid-cycle: ABORT (TOCTOU protection)

**Step 2: Check Pending Blocks**
- For each pending block with `confirmations >= maturityDepth` (default 100):
  - Verify: `getblockhash(block.height) == block.hash`
  - 3 consecutive matches: status -> `confirmed`
  - 3 consecutive mismatches: status -> `orphaned`

**Step 3: Deep Reorg Check (every 10th cycle, ~100 min)**
- Re-verify ALL confirmed (unpaid) blocks up to 1000 confirmations deep
- 3 consecutive hash mismatches: status -> `orphaned`, alert operator

Source: `internal/payments/processor.go`

## 11. Payout Processing

### Scheme: SOLO (Coinbase Payout)

100% of block reward (subsidy + transaction fees) goes directly to the miner via the **coinbase transaction** embedded in the block template. No separate payment RPC call is needed — the blockchain pays the miner directly.

### Maturation Flow

1. Block found — miner's address is already in the coinbase output
2. Payment processor tracks confirmations (status: `pending`)
3. After 100+ confirmations and 3 stable hash checks → `confirmed`
4. Block remains in `confirmed` status permanently (coinbase TX is the payment)

> **Advisory lock:** The payment processor acquires a PostgreSQL advisory lock (per-pool FNV hash) at the start of each cycle for HA fencing, but the actual `confirmed → paid` transition is a no-op in SOLO mode.

Payment fencing is described in [SECURITY_MODEL.md](SECURITY_MODEL.md).

## 12. Daemon Communication

### RPC Methods

| Method | Purpose | Frequency |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `getblocktemplate` | Fetch block template | On ZMQ notify or periodic refresh (blockTime/3, min 5s) |
| `submitblock` | Submit found block | On block discovery |
| `getblockchaininfo` | Chain height + network state | Every poll cycle (1s) |
| `getblockhash` | Hash at specific height | Every payment cycle |
| `validateaddress` | Validate pool payout addr | At startup (once) |
| `getnetworkinfo` | Daemon version/capabilities | At startup (once) |

### Block Notification Modes

| Mode | Mechanism | Latency |
|------|-----------|---------|
| ZMQ (preferred) | `zmq:hashblock` push | <1 second |
| RPC Polling (fallback) | `getblockchaininfo` every 1s | up to 1 second |

Strategy: Start with polling, promote to ZMQ once connection stable.

### Retry Policy

Max retries: 3, initial backoff: 500ms, max backoff: 10s, factor: 2.0x

Note: Column names use no underscores in Go code (`poolid`, `blockheight`).

### Auxiliary (Merge-Mined) Pool Tables

Auxiliary pools created by merge mining get their own set of per-pool tables. The aux pool ID is constructed by appending the lowercase aux symbol to the parent pool ID:

```
auxPoolID = {parentPoolID}_{auxSymbol}
```

Source: `internal/pool/coordinator.go:229`

Each aux pool gets the same table set as a parent pool: `blocks_{auxPoolID}`, `shares_{auxPoolID}`, `worker_hashrate_history_{auxPoolID}`.

**Example table names for all merge mining pairs:**

| Parent | Aux | Aux Pool ID | Blocks Table |
|--------|-----|-------------|--------------|
| BTC | NMC | `btc_sha256_1_nmc` | `blocks_btc_sha256_1_nmc` |
| BTC | SYS | `btc_sha256_1_sys` | `blocks_btc_sha256_1_sys` |
| BTC | XMY | `btc_sha256_1_xmy` | `blocks_btc_sha256_1_xmy` |
| BTC | FBTC | `btc_sha256_1_fbtc` | `blocks_btc_sha256_1_fbtc` |
| LTC | DOGE | `ltc_scrypt_1_doge` | `blocks_ltc_scrypt_1_doge` |
| LTC | PEP | `ltc_scrypt_1_pep` | `blocks_ltc_scrypt_1_pep` |

Pool ID validation: `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]{0,62}$` (no hyphens — not valid PostgreSQL identifiers).

### Write Performance

| Operation | Method | Throughput |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Share inserts | PostgreSQL COPY | ~5K-10K shares/sec |
| Block inserts | Standard INSERT | Negligible volume |
| Worker updates | UPSERT | Per-session cadence |

## 14. High Availability and Failover

> **Bare metal / self-hosted VMs only.** HA is not supported on cloud or VPS deployments. Keepalived VRRP (used for VIP failover) requires broadcast/multicast MAC election, which is blocked by cloud hypervisors. Both the installer and `spiralctl ha enable` hard-block HA setup when a cloud environment is detected.

### HA Architecture

```
+----------------+          +----------------+
|   Node 1       |          |   Node 2       |
|   (MASTER)     |          |   (BACKUP)     |
|                |          |                |
|  Spiral Pool   |<-- WAL ->|  Spiral Pool   |

|  Payments: ON  |          |  Payments: OFF |
+-------+--------+          +-------+--------+
        |                           |
        |     +----------+          |
        +---->|   VIP    |<---------+
              | Virtual  |  <-- Miners connect here
              | IP Addr  |
              +----------+
```

### Failover Manager

Health check: UDP broadcast heartbeats (default 30s interval) with HTTP `/status` fallback (port 5354). Primary declared dead after `FailoverTimeout` (default 90s, ≥ 3 missed heartbeats). Eligible backup with highest priority starts election and acquires VIP.

### HA Components

| Component | HA Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ha-role-watcher.sh` | Polls every 5s, controls service start/stop |
| `ha-service-control.sh` | Starts/stops spiralsentinel + spiraldash |
| Sentinel | Defense-in-depth: `is_master_sentinel()` suppresses alerts on non-MASTER |
| Dashboard | No built-in HA check; relies on systemd service control |
| Docker | Known limitation: no role watcher. Sentinel alerts safe, services duplicated |

Source: `src/sentinel/SpiralSentinel.py`, `src/dashboard/dashboard.py`

**Monitoring modes:** Most miners are monitored by directly polling their HTTP or CGMiner API for temperature, hashrate, uptime, and health data. ESP32 lottery miners (NerdMiner, BitMaker, etc.) are an exception — they have no device API, so Sentinel monitors them indirectly by polling the pool's stratum connections endpoint (`/api/pools/{id}/connections`). This provides online/offline status, hashrate, and share data, but not temperature, fan speed, or power consumption. ESP32 miners must be manually added via `spiralctl scan --add <IP>`. See [MINER_SUPPORT.md](../reference/MINER_SUPPORT.md) for full details.

## 20. End-to-End Data Flows

### Flow 1: ESP32 Miner Connects and Submits First Share

1. TCP connect to pool:3333
2. Create Session (atomic session ID, unique extranonce1)
3. Spiral Router classifies "esp32-miner/1.0" -> MinerClass.Lottery
4. Profile: InitialDiff=0.001, MinDiff=0.0001, MaxDiff=100, TargetShareTime=60s
5. Initialize VARDIFF SessionState (all atomic fields)
6. Subscribe response + set_difficulty(0.001)
7. Authorize "DAddr.esp32worker"
8. mining.notify with job
9. Miner hashes ~60 seconds, submits share
10. Validate: rate limit -> job lookup -> dup check -> hash -> diff check
11. share_diff >= 0.001 -> VALID, < network_diff -> not a block
12. Ring buffer push (lock-free CAS), metrics update
13. VARDIFF: 1 share in 60s, ratio ~1.0, within 50% variance -> no adjustment
14. Batch writer drains ring buffer -> WAL -> PostgreSQL COPY

### Flow 2: Antminer S19 Finds a Block

1. Share hash meets network difficulty -> BLOCK FOUND
2. Build complete block (header + coinbase + all TXs)
3. Write to WAL (durability)
4. `submitblock` -> accepted
5. INSERT into blocks table (status: "pending")
6. Broadcast mining.notify (clean_jobs=true)
7. Prometheus: blocks_found_total++
8. Sentinel: Discord/Telegram alert
9. Payment processor (10-min cycles) checks confirmations
10. After 100+ confirmations and 3 stable hash checks -> "confirmed"
11. Block remains "confirmed" permanently (SOLO: coinbase already paid miner at block creation)

## Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Performance | Bottleneck |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Share validation | <100us per share | CPU (atomic ops) |
| Share persistence | 5K-10K shares/sec | PostgreSQL COPY |
| Job broadcast | <100ms to all miners | Network I/O |
| Block submission | 1-5 seconds | Daemon RPC |

| Component | Memory Usage |
|-----------|-------------|
| Per session | ~1 KB |
| Share ring buffer | ~256 MB (1M x 256 bytes) |
| Job cache | ~100 KB (100 jobs x 1 KB) |
| Metrics | <10 MB |
